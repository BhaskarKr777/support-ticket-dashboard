# Decisions

## 1. NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIAGE_API_KEY

The assignment mentions using `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIAGE_API_KEY` for the "Re-run AI" action on the ticket page.

However, in the "How we judge" section, it is mentioned that secrets should be kept out of the browser.

These two requirements conflict because `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are exposed to the browser.

I decided to keep the API key server-side and use a Next.js API route for the re-triage request instead of exposing the key to the client.
